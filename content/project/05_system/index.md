Industrial Systems

**---------------**

In Siemens AG, as a software test engineer, I was engaged in developing test concepts and programs for TIA portal and SIMATIC relevant products based on C#. Here I had the chance to use and understand more about PLC and industrial control systems.

In Trumpf GmbH, as a R&D intern, I was focusing on the development of OPC-UA relevant technicals, which are maily used for communication between KUKA robot and sensors.

Distributed Systems

**---------------**

Except algorithm and math problems, system development is also an interesting art of technology. Among them, distributed system could enhance performance of applications and may provide more possibilities and availabilities. Furthermore, combining AI and distributed system is also going to be a research hotspot recently. Currently, I am studying the relevant courses and technicals in Cousera such as Docker, Spark and HDFS.
