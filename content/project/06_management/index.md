Techfest TUM

**---------------**

The TECHFEST MUNICH is an international technology festival and hackathon. I have participated in this hackathon in 2018 and luckily won the 2nd place at the Siemens-sponsered challenge "let it flow" with an AI-and Data-based Alarm system for production line.

Leadership & Teamwork

**---------------**

After successful working of workshop "Mechatronische Systeme und Produkte" as a teamplayer, I have also participated in the workshop "Leadership of interdisciplinary teams" at the next year. Here I have learned how to lead employees in product development in a practical environment.
