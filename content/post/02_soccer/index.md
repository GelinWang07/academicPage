Soccer
===============
Since 2019 I was elected as captain of Karlsruhe Chinese Soccer Club. Every year our team not only joins the competition games between chinese teams from other cities in Europe, but also plays the friend match with German soccer clubs. We have also won the 2nd Prize in the  "South Germany Cup" between Chinese soccer clubs before. Our soccer family is always open for more friends to join us.
