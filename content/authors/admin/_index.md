I am a Chinese student studying mechatronics and information technology as Master at **[Karslruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/)**, Germany. I have obtained my bachelor degree with the same major at KIT. Now I am writing my master thesis in the R&D department at **[Trumpf Gmbh + Co.KG](https://www.trumpf.com/)** (Ditzingen, Germany), and under the supervision of **[Prof. Gisela Lanza](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/21_90.php)** and **[Jan-Philipp Kaiser](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/21_3748.php)** (wbk Institute of Production Science, KIT). On this website, you can find information about my work, research and interests. 

My work and research are mainly focused on **AI and robotics, sensor and system development, CV and SLAM**. In the field of industrial usages, **the management and development of production** are also the challenges I am looking forward to. Currently, my work is focusing on **distributed machine learning**. After my master study at KIT in early 2022, I am seeking for the opportunities of a ***Ph.D position*** in the above mentioned area. If you are interested in my work, don't be hesitated to contact me for the further cooperation.
